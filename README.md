# NYU-Tandon-Operating-System-Assigment
Assigment from CS6233 â€“ Introduction to Operating Systems. This course provides you with a high level overview of all the significant aspects of the inner workings of the operating system, such as interaction with hardware, resource management, interaction with applications, synchronization primitives and file systems. The course will briefly touch on some advanced concepts, such as distributed systems and virtualization. For those interested in security, I also cover some topics on Operating Systems security.
